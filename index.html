            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="about">
                <p>Our group is developing a service to bring the community together. Our vision is to hold a monthly community workshop at our school facilities. This will entail members of the community either holding or attending workshops to learn a variety of skills (e.g. new sports, knitting, changing a tire, gardening, etc). The demographic we are targeting includes all ages and abilities, replicating the community dynamic of multi-generational ages. This workshop will take place on the school grounds which is a great way to represent and appreciate our school, yet it could bring potential safety concerns. We endeavour for marketing to play a large role in the success of our project. We plan to advertise this through online social media platforms and posters around central community events and places. This event will provide the opportunity for community building and diversity, which we want to place a big importance on as we want it to reflect our school culture and key value of community which helps form the basis of success in the 21st Century learning environment. Finally, we want to keep the costs involved to a minimal by using a volunteer-based approach and utilising school equipment where possible helping keep this event free, ongoing, and fun!</p>
